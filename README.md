# Dentalium_1
A scholar project which represents a website of an eventual dental center. Only 4 pages are built for a time of 2 months but working only during weekends. jQuery, jQuery Validation, jQuery UI and Bootstrap are used. This is the front-end part from the first semester.
Note: If you download the repository you'll have to unzip the files located in the following folders: "./project-images" and "./css/images" to see and explore all the layout.
